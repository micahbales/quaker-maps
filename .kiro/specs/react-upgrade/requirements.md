# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for upgrading the Quaker Maps application from React 16.9 to the latest version of React (18.x). The upgrade aims to modernize the codebase, improve performance, enhance security, and ensure long-term maintainability while preserving all existing functionality and user experience.

The current application uses React 16.9 with Material-UI v4, React Router v5, and other legacy dependencies that need coordinated updates to maintain compatibility and leverage modern React features.
