# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for resolving peer dependency conflicts in the Quaker Maps application that currently require the use of the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. The goal is to eliminate the need for this flag by updating dependencies to compatible versions, ensuring a stable and maintainable dependency tree while preserving all existing functionality.

The current application has peer dependency conflicts primarily between TypeScript versions, ESLint configurations, and some MUI package versions that prevent clean installation without the legacy flag.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Eliminate Legacy Peer Dependencies Flag

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install dependencies without the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag so that the project has a stable and predictable dependency resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm install` THEN the command SHALL complete successfully without warnings or errors
2. WHEN running `npm install` THEN the command SHALL NOT require the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN there SHALL be no peer dependency conflict warnings
4. WHEN the package-lock.json is generated THEN it SHALL reflect a clean dependency tree without overrides
5. WHEN new developers clone the project THEN they SHALL be able to run `npm install` without additional flags

### Requirement 2: TypeScript Version Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript to be at a version compatible with all project dependencies so that compilation works correctly without version conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN it SHALL be compatible with react-scripts version requirements
2. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN all existing TypeScript code SHALL compile without errors
3. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN ESLint TypeScript plugins SHALL be compatible
4. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN the version SHALL support all current language features used in the project
5. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN type checking SHALL pass for all components and utilities

### Requirement 3: ESLint Configuration Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint and its plugins to work together without version conflicts so that code linting functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint plugins are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with the installed ESLint version
2. WHEN ESLint plugins are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with the TypeScript version
3. WHEN ESLint runs THEN it SHALL not produce any configuration or plugin compatibility errors
4. WHEN ESLint runs THEN it SHALL maintain the same linting rules and code quality standards
5. WHEN ESLint plugins are updated THEN they SHALL work correctly with react-scripts

### Requirement 4: React Scripts Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want react-scripts to work with compatible dependency versions so that the build system functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN react-scripts dependencies are resolved THEN they SHALL be compatible with the installed TypeScript version
2. WHEN react-scripts runs THEN the development server SHALL start without dependency warnings
3. WHEN react-scripts builds the project THEN the build SHALL complete successfully
4. WHEN react-scripts is used THEN all existing npm scripts SHALL continue to function
5. WHEN react-scripts is updated THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with React 18 and MUI v5

### Requirement 5: MUI Package Version Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all MUI packages to be at compatible versions so that the UI library functions correctly without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN @mui/material, @mui/icons-material, and @mui/styles SHALL be at compatible versions
2. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with React 18
3. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with emotion dependencies
4. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN all existing UI components SHALL render correctly
5. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN the theme system SHALL continue to function as expected

### Requirement 6: Testing Library Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing libraries to be compatible with React 18 and other dependencies so that tests run correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing libraries are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with React 18
2. WHEN testing libraries are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with the Jest version provided by react-scripts
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute without dependency-related errors
4. WHEN testing libraries are updated THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
5. WHEN testing libraries are updated THEN test utilities SHALL function correctly with updated components

### Requirement 7: Application Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application features to continue working exactly as before so that dependency updates don't affect my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN the interactive map SHALL display and function correctly
2. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN meeting search and filtering SHALL work as expected
3. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN navigation and routing SHALL function properly
4. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN the meeting update form SHALL submit successfully
5. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN responsive design SHALL work on all devices
6. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN all existing user workflows SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 8: Development Workflow Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all development commands and workflows to continue working so that productivity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm start` SHALL launch the development server successfully
2. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm run build` SHALL create production builds without errors
3. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm test` SHALL run all tests successfully
4. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm run lint` SHALL check code quality without errors
5. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm run type-check` SHALL validate TypeScript types correctly
6. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN deployment scripts SHALL function as expected
