# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for modernizing the Quaker Maps application's build system and dependency stack. The goal is to migrate from Create React App (react-scripts) to Vite and upgrade to the latest versions of React, TypeScript, and other core dependencies, eliminating peer dependency conflicts and establishing a modern, performant development environment.

The current application uses react-scripts which constrains TypeScript to version 4.x and creates peer dependency conflicts. By migrating to Vite, we can use the latest TypeScript 5.x, React 18.3.x, and modern tooling while achieving faster build times and better developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Eliminate Legacy Peer Dependencies Flag

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install dependencies without the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag so that the project has a stable and predictable dependency resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm install` THEN the command SHALL complete successfully without warnings or errors
2. WHEN running `npm install` THEN the command SHALL NOT require the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN there SHALL be no peer dependency conflict warnings
4. WHEN the package-lock.json is generated THEN it SHALL reflect a clean dependency tree without overrides
5. WHEN new developers clone the project THEN they SHALL be able to run `npm install` without additional flags

### Requirement 2: Modern TypeScript and React Versions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the latest stable versions of TypeScript and React so that I can leverage modern language features and performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN it SHALL be upgraded to the latest stable version (5.9.x)
2. WHEN React is updated THEN it SHALL be upgraded to the latest stable 18.x version (18.3.x)
3. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN all existing TypeScript code SHALL compile without errors
4. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN ESLint TypeScript plugins SHALL be compatible with the new version
5. WHEN React is updated THEN all existing components SHALL render and function correctly with proven dependency compatibility

### Requirement 3: ESLint Configuration Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint and its plugins to work together without version conflicts so that code linting functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint plugins are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with the installed ESLint version
2. WHEN ESLint plugins are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with the TypeScript version
3. WHEN ESLint runs THEN it SHALL not produce any configuration or plugin compatibility errors
4. WHEN ESLint runs THEN it SHALL maintain the same linting rules and code quality standards
5. WHEN ESLint plugins are updated THEN they SHALL work correctly with react-scripts

### Requirement 4: Vite Build System Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Vite as the build system so that I have faster development builds, better TypeScript support, and modern tooling capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vite is configured THEN the development server SHALL start faster than react-scripts
2. WHEN Vite builds the project THEN the build SHALL complete successfully with optimized output
3. WHEN Vite is used THEN hot module replacement SHALL work correctly for all file types
4. WHEN Vite is configured THEN it SHALL support the latest TypeScript and React versions natively
5. WHEN Vite replaces react-scripts THEN all existing npm scripts SHALL be updated to work with Vite

### Requirement 5: Latest MUI and Modern Styling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the latest MUI version with modern styling approaches so that I have access to the newest components and performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN @mui/material and @mui/icons-material SHALL be at the latest stable version (7.x)
2. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with React 18.3.x
3. WHEN @mui/styles is removed THEN existing styled components SHALL be migrated to @mui/system or emotion
4. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN all existing UI components SHALL render correctly
5. WHEN MUI packages are updated THEN the theme system SHALL continue to function with modern styling approaches

### Requirement 6: Modern Testing Setup with Vitest

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use modern testing tools that integrate well with Vite so that tests run faster and have better TypeScript support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing setup is migrated THEN it SHALL use Vitest for unit testing with Vite integration
2. WHEN testing libraries are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with React 18.3.x
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute faster than the previous Jest setup
4. WHEN testing libraries are updated THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
5. WHEN Vitest is configured THEN it SHALL provide better TypeScript support and error reporting

### Requirement 7: Application Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application features to continue working exactly as before so that dependency updates don't affect my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN the interactive map SHALL display and function correctly
2. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN meeting search and filtering SHALL work as expected
3. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN navigation and routing SHALL function properly
4. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN the meeting update form SHALL submit successfully
5. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN responsive design SHALL work on all devices
6. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN all existing user workflows SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 8: Modern ESLint and Code Quality Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the latest ESLint and TypeScript ESLint plugins so that I have access to the newest linting rules and better code quality enforcement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint is updated THEN it SHALL be upgraded to the latest stable version (9.x)
2. WHEN TypeScript ESLint plugins are updated THEN they SHALL be upgraded to the latest stable version (8.x)
3. WHEN ESLint is updated THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with Vite and TypeScript 5.x
4. WHEN ESLint configuration is updated THEN it SHALL maintain existing code quality standards
5. WHEN ESLint is updated THEN it SHALL provide better performance and error reporting

### Requirement 9: Development Workflow Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all development commands and workflows to continue working so that productivity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm start` SHALL launch the development server successfully
2. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm run build` SHALL create production builds without errors
3. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm test` SHALL run all tests successfully
4. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm run lint` SHALL check code quality without errors
5. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN `npm run type-check` SHALL validate TypeScript types correctly
6. WHEN dependency updates are complete THEN deployment scripts SHALL function as expected
