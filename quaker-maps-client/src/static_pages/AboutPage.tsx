        <h2>Quakerism</h2>

        <p>This website is intended to be a resource to get a better sense of what the Religious Society of Friends looks like. Friends are only a tiny portion of the population even in the areas where we have the strongest presence, yet we are all over the United States and the world. While there are some parts of the United States where Quakers are very rare, Friends Meetings and churches can be found across the country.</p>

        <p>In most of the world Friends are much more uncommon than they are in the United States, but there are a few hot spots where Quaker churches have taken root to a remarkable degree, including East Africa, Central America, Bolivia, England and Ireland.</p>

        <h2>Quakermaps.com</h2>

        <p>The goal of this website is to help all of us become more familiar with the dimensions of the Quaker community - to make visible the geography of the Quaker world. Friends talk about Philadelphia Yearly Meeting – but what are its geographic boundaries? We may have heard of Mid-America Yearly Meeting – but where exactly is it? Whether your goal is to find a Friends Meeting near you or to better understand the lay of the land, QuakerMaps is designed to orient you.</p>

        <h2>How We Gather Information</h2>

        <p>All of the addresses, directions, meeting times, etc that you will find on Quakermaps.com have been consolidated from publicly available listings on the internet. If there is information missing about the Quaker Meeting that you are looking for, it may be because that information is not listed online.</p>

        <p>Friends have generally been moving information onto the internet, but in some cases this is a fairly slow process. We welcome Monthly and Yearly Meetings and worship groups to contact us to provide us with more information.</p>

        <p>Quaker Maps is a project of the <a href="https://www.fojf.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends of Jesus Fellowship</a>.</p>
