        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>How do you collect your information?</h2>

        <p>Our information comes from publicly available information on the internet. That means that if a Yearly or Monthly Meeting is not listed on Quakermaps.com, it is likely because they have not made their information easily accessible online. (We're looking at you, Britain Yearly Meeting.)</p>

        <h2>What is Quakerism?</h2>
        
        <p>It is a religious movement sprung from a group of radical Christians in the 17th Century which has grown and changed into a modern body containing several branches.</p>

        <h2>Why isn’t my church/meeting listed on Quakermaps.com?</h2>

        <p>It was either an oversight, or we were unable to find your information online. If your meeting is missing, please contact us and provide basic information on your Meeting or worship group.</p>

        <h2>Why isn’t my Yearly Meeting listed on Quakermaps.com?</h2>
        
        <p>At the present time, Quakermaps.com includes all of the Yearly Meetings that we are aware of in North America. Our ultimate goal is total coverage. However, there are a lot of technical hurdles standing in the way of this - mostly a lack of publicly available information. If you have that information and would like to help us get your Yearly Meeting listed, get in touch!</p>

        <h2>My Meeting is/is not LGBT-affirming - why do you say we are/are not?</h2>

        <p>Our approach to categorization of meetings assumes that congregations are not welcoming to LGBT folks unless we have reason to believe that they are. We generally assume that meetings belonging to Friends General Conference are affirming. We generally assume that most everyone else is not affirming, unless we are specifically aware that a church is affirming.</p>
        
        <p>These are broad assumptions, and we are going to be wrong a lot! For the safety of LGBT folks, when en doubt, we try to err on the side of assuming a congregation is not affirming. You can help us by correcting us when you find a meeting that is mis-categorized. And please, if you let us know that a meeting is, in fact, an affirming congregation, point us to some public statement they've made that they welcome LGBT folks in all aspects of life and leadership.</p>

        <h2>My Meeting is listed, but its information is wrong or incomplete.</h2>

        <p>Please contact us and let us know how we can enhance or correct our listing! It's most helpful if you can point to a church/meeting website where we can verify the details you send us.</p>

        <h2>Who runs this site?</h2>

        <p>Quaker Maps is a project of the <a href="https://www.fojf.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends of Jesus Fellowship</a>.</p>
