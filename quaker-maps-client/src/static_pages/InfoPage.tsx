    <h1>A Brief Introduction to Quakerism</h1>

    <blockquote>“Christ is come to teach his people himself” - George Fox</blockquote>

    <img

    <h2>Quakerism 101</h2>

    <p>
      Quakerism arises out of a radical interpretation of Christianity that understands Christ as
      being a living reality in personal experience, not only in the Bible and Church tradition. The
      basic discovery of the Friends movement is – in the words of George Fox, the movement’s
      founder – that “Christ is come to teach his people himself.”
    </p>

    <p>
      While Friends today understand this in a variety of different ways, the foundational belief
      that underlies all of Quaker faith and practice is that God is knowable by every human being,
      and that the Spirit of God will lead us into all truth if we are faithful in hearing and
      obeying God’s voice in our hearts. Friends believe that all people have the capacity to know
      the truth and to discern the will of God. Friends believe that not only are we able to know
      God’s will, but that through God’s grace we are empowered to do it.
    </p>

    <h3>Inward Truth; Outward Faithfulness</h3>

    <p>
      Friends testify to an inward experience of the Spirit of Christ that is available to each
      individual, but Quakerism is not an individualistic path. Just as the Holy Spirit speaks to us
      directly as individuals, we also experience God speaking to us as a group when we gather with
      the intention to receive God’s will together. Friends believe that to be fully faithful to
      God, our individualism will be brought under control and we will be gathered into community
      that seeks to know and live out the divine will.
    </p>

        height: '300px',
        paddingRight: '15px',
      }}
    />

    <p>
      Quakers believe that all of life has the potential to be sacramental. The reality of God’s
      power and love can be embodied and experienced in every aspect of life. Rather than placing
      our emphasis on specific days, times, rituals or ceremonies, Friends place our focus on the
      possibility of God’s presence and action in every moment.
    </p>

    <h3>The Social Testimonies</h3>

    <p>
      Quakers are well-known for our Peace Testimony. Friends oppose war in all forms, based on our
      conviction that Christ has commanded us to lay aside our earthly weapons and rely only upon
      the power of God’s love, trusting in God’s justice. This conviction goes further than simply
      denying participation in war: Friends seek to let our whole lives be expressions of peace in a
      world that is wracked by conflict and violence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another of Friends’ core beliefs is the Testimony of Simplicity. It is our conviction that God
      should be the Center and Orderer of our lives, and we seek to let all of our actions,
      possessions and relationships be in the service of Truth. This testimony includes seeking to
      lead lives of material simplicity, trusting that God has indeed provided for the needs of all,
      but recognizing that material luxury leads to spiritual deprivation and environmental
      destruction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Friends recognize that all people are loved by God and have value based on their relationship
      with their Creator. From this basis, Friends have developed a Testimony of Equality, which
      emphasizes the fundamental brotherhood and sisterhood of all people. Friends reject titles,
      honorifics and other social constructions that are designed to elevate individuals based on
      human standards of prestige. We seek to treat with love and respect those whom the wider
      society rejects or deems inferior.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Testimony of Integrity is a recognition that the Spirit calls us to lead lives of honesty
      in all our dealings.We are called to lead lives of openness and authenticity, speaking clearly
      and honestly, and showing consistency between our religious faith and the way that we live.
    </p>

    <h3>Quaker Practice</h3>

    <img

      alt="Wood print of The Peaceable Kingdom"
      style={{
        float: 'right',
        height: '300px',
        paddingRight: '15px',
      }}
    />

    <p>
      There are two corporate practices that are distinctive to Friends and which deserve special
      attention in any introduction to the Quaker movement: Waiting worship and Friends’
      decision-making process.
    </p>

    <p>
      The heart of our worship together is expectant waiting on God, often referred to as “open
      worship, ” “silent worship, ” or “unprogrammed worship.” Friends sit together for a set period
      (though times can vary, depending on how we feel led by God). During this time, our worship is
      based in expectant silence. We wait on God, opening ourselves to the Spirit’s working in our
      hearts and praying that God give us a message as individuals, as well as for the group as a
      whole. Sometimes, no one speaks during the entire period. Other times, there may be several
      messages that God gives us to speak or sing out loud. Whether or not there is vocal ministry,
      there is often a felt sense of Christ’s presence with us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Friends way of making decisions is based on this same expectation that God’s Spirit will be
      present with us and guide us as a group. When Friends meet together to make decisions as a
      group, we spend time in expectant waiting – just as in Meeting for Worship. Unlike Meeting for
      Worship, however, we come to the meeting with specific questions for God, seeking guidance in
      our affairs as a community. In coming to decisions, Friends do not vote. Instead, we seek the
      “sense of the Meeting” – the discernment of the gathered community of what God’s will is for
      that community at that time. When Friends come to a decision, there is a sense that God has
      led us to it. Consequently, decisions made in the manner of Friends tend to garner much
      greater commitment from all involved in the process – even those who would have personally
      preferred that a different choice be made.
    </p>

    <h2>The Modern - Day Diversity of Friends</h2>

    <p>
      In the past 150 years, Friends in North America have diverged widely in faith and practice.
      While Friends as a whole can still generally affirm the belief and practices outlined above,
      divisions in North American Quakerism have become increasingly entrenched over the past
      century. At this point in time, there are five general perspectives to be found within the
      Religious Society of Friends: universalist Liberal, Christ-centered Liberal, conservative,
      orthodox, and Evangelical. These perspectives are not well-defined, identifiable groups;
      rather, they are points on a spectrum that runs through North American Quakerism.
    </p>

    <h3>Universalist Liberal</h3>

    <img
      src={liberal}
      style={{
        float: 'left',
        height: '300px',
        paddingRight: '15px',
      }}
      alt="universalist liberal quakers"
    />

    <p>
      Friends of this perspective, while recognizing that Quakerism has historically been a branch
      of the Christian Church, do not believe that Quakerism is or should be limited to a Christian
      – or Western – understanding. Friends who hold this perspective often see Quakerism as a
      meeting ground for followers of various world religions – and of none at all. The Friends
      practice of worship in expectant silence is often seen as particularly conducive to interfaith
      dialogue, as people of all faiths can benefit from contemplation and grounded sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Universalist Liberal Friends tend to put little or no emphasis on theology as a basis for
      membership in the local Meeting. Instead, adherence to Friends practices – however interpreted
      by the individual – is the cornerstone of participation in the Society of Friends.
    </p>

    <p>
      In North America, Friends from this perspective are primarily found in the Liberal Yearly
      Meetings.
    </p>

    <h3>Christ-Centered Liberal</h3>

    <img
      src={christCentered}
      style={{
        float: 'right',
        height: '300px',
        paddingRight: '15px',
      }}
      alt="christ-centered liberal quakers"
    />

    <p>
      The Christ-centered Liberal viewpoint is that, while Quakerism should not be defined by any
      particular set of beliefs, the life and teachings of Jesus are central to their personal faith
      journey. Some Christ-centered Liberal Friends would self-identify as Christians; others would
      not. On an individual level, the perspective of Christ-centered Liberal Friends is different
      from that of universalist Liberal Friends, but there is not necessarily any conflict between
      these two perspectives in their view of the Meeting community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Christ-centered Liberal Friends are in general agreement with universalists in their view of
      the role of belief and practice. While Christ - centered Friends find the life and teachings
      of Jesus to be deeply significant for them as individuals, they are comfortable co-existing in
      Meetings that have no common faith in Jesus. They see sharing in a loving community, relying
      on Friends practices, and listening for truth wherever it can be found, as a sufficient basis
      for membership in the Meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Friends from this perspective can be found throughout the Religious Society of Friends in
      North America; especially in Liberal Yearly Meetings, but also in some orthodox Yearly
      Meetings.
    </p>

    <h3>Conservative</h3>

    <img
      src={conservative}
      style={{
        float: 'left',
        height: '300px',
        paddingRight: '15px',
      }}
      alt="conservative quakers"
    />

    <p>
      Friends who hold a conservative viewpoint (whether or not they are members of a Conservative
      Yearly Meeting) are in some ways similar to Christ-centered Liberal Friends. Both see Friends
      practices of waiting worship and decision-making as being central to their understanding of
      what it means to be a Friend, and both have a personal commitment to Jesus as Guide and
      Teacher. Unlike Christ-centered Liberal Friends, however, Friends from the conservative
      perspective hold that faith in Jesus Christ and fidelity to the Christian tradition are
      essential for the Meeting community as a whole. Friends from the conservative viewpoint see
      common Christian faith – not only common worship and decision-making practice – as being the
      basis for membership in the Meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Friends with a conservative perspective can be found in the Conservative Yearly Meetings, but
      also to some degree in the Liberal and orthodox branches.
    </p>

    <h3>Orthodox</h3>

    <img
      src={evangelical}
      style={{
        float: 'right',
        height: '300px',
        paddingRight: '15px',
      }}
      alt="evangelical quakers"
    />

    <p>
      While in agreement with Conservative Friends that Christian faith is crucial for the Meeting
      as a whole, orthodox Friends are more open to modifying Friends practice to better suit what
      they sense to be the needs of their local community. While most orthodox Friends still
      practice waiting worship, almost all orthodox Friends now include prepared elements in their
      worship services. Employing congregational singing and prepared sermons, Meetings with a
      predominantly orthodox viewpoint might, at first glance, appear similar to mainline or
      Evangelical Protestant services.
    </p>

    <p>
      The great majority of orthodox Friends employ pastors to assist with education, worship
      services, and pastoral care of the congregation. But unlike in some Protestant churches,
      orthodox Friends pastors are understood to be "released" for religious serviece. The pastorate
      is not a position of special liturgical or decision-making authority. The pastor serves as an
      equipping elder, but not as "clergy."
    </p>

    <img
      src={fundamentalist}
      style={{
        float: 'left',
        height: '300px',
        paddingRight: '15px',
      }}
      alt="fundamentalist quakers"
    />

    <p>
      There are Friends of an orthodox perspective throughout the orthodox and Evangelical branches.
    </p>

    <h3>Evangelical</h3>

    <p>
      Evangelical Friends share a religious culture and self-understanding that is highly influenced
      by Evangelical Protestantism. Friends from the Evangelical stream tend to have fully
      programmed worship services, in the celebration-oriented style of the wider Evangelical
      Protestant Church. Silence may be minimal or absent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Evangelical Friends have a very high view of Scripture, often holding to a doctrine of{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_infallibility">infallibility</a> or{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy">inerrancy</a>. They tend to assign
      more authority to designated officers than most orthodox Friends churches. Frequently, the
      pastors and a small group of leaders, serve as the primary decision-makers for most church
      governance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Evangelical Friends can be found in the Evangelical branch, and to a lesser degree in the
      orthodox branch.
